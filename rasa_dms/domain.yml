  utter_Change_package-1:
  - text: "SubmitCI is triggered when a CP is put to Submitted state.\n To run a CP in SubmitCI, PreintCI stage is mocked up that just pulls in the latest group build from the integrator's standard nightly builds, against which the CP will be built and tested. 
          \n The group build is then expanded out into a VM template"         
  utter_Change_package-2:
  - text: "Depending on the target environment of the CP, the correct template is picked to fire up a new VM which contains the required group build to run the SubmitCI stage.In the VM, the CP files are loaded. It also pulls other CPs that have either overlapping files (closed after baseline) or/and user dependencies with the main CP. "

  utter_build_cp1:
  - text: "If you just submit your CP without running a single test or check then the chances of it being rejected are higher. 
           Now for a small change then that might be quite safe to do based on your evaluation of the change. 
           For a larger change you probably want to run some checks to give you the confidence that the code is likely to just flow in but developers
           should be able to decide whether that's 100 tests, 1,000 tests or 10,000 tests."
  utter_build_cp2:
  - text: "To update test YAML rules, please drop email to NX-Test-Efficiency-CI NX-Test-Efficiency-CI@ugs.com.\nIf developer puts the CP in submit state, code review and pipeline build will happen in
           parallel and in most cases before reviewers have even started to look at the change package, results will be available from the CI pipeline"

Any new incoming incidents, requests, issues will be handled on ServiceNow. Please use the below link to raise any request related to Build, Validate, Test component and Dashboard and the same link is updated in SubmitCI failure emails sent to developers."
